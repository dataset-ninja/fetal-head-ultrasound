**Automated Measurement Of Fetal Head Circumference Using 2D UltraSound Images** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the biological research. 

The dataset consists of 1334 images with 999 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*fetal head circumference*).

Images in the Fetal Head UltraSound dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 335 (25% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (999 images) and *test* (335 images). The dataset was released in 2018 by the Radboud University Nijmegen.
